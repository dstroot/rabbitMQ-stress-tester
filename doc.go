Introduction
------------

RabbitMQ is an AMQP-compliant queue broker. It exists to facilitate
the passing of messages between or within systems. It is tremendously
capable: Iâ€™ve seen a RabbitMQ instance running on a single, moderately
sized, VM handle almost 3GB/s.

This program is designed for load testing with RabbitMQ.
